File-Folder structure in Angular 

App Module
Core Module: Sigletons(NavBar)

Shared Module: Shared components. 
Feature Module: App features, Each feature
    we create will have its own module and routing 


// File and folders organising 
ng g m core : src/app/core/core.module.ts (190 bytes)
ng g m shop
ng g m shared


// In site shop module
ng g c shop --flat  --skip-tests
ng g s shop --skip-tests --flat 

ng g m shop-routing --flat


// Angular services is Sigletons


Adding new feature modules
Setting up routes
Nav links
Lazy loading 


SPA's (singal page application)  need routers
Angular router will load a component when route is activated
<RouterOutlet><RouterOutlet>
Module architecture of our app encourages lazy loading  


** Crating additional components to route to 
ng g m home
cd home
ng g c home -skip-tests --flat
cd shop
ng g c product-details --skip-tests




Interceptors are a way to do some work for every single HTTP request or response.
Add a token or some custom HTTP header for all outgoing HTTP requests.
Catch HTTP responses to do some custom formatting (i.e. convert CSV to JSON) before handing the data over to your service/component.
Log all HTTP activity in the console
